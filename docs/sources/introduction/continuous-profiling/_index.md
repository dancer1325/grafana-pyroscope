* see [continuous profiling](../profiling.md#continuous-profiling)
* alternative to pyroscope
  * run a benchmark tool locally and get a .pprof | Go or .jrf | Java
    * ğŸ‘€NOT recommendation | production ğŸ‘€
* how does it work?
  * collect profiles | production systems
  * stores the profiles | database

## Benefits

* see [continuous profiling](../profiling.md#continuous-profiling)

### Reduce operational costs

* operational costs -- come from --
  * infrastructure
  * observability,
  * incident management,
  * messaging/queuing,
  * deployment tools

* costs of using Pyroscope
  * minimal overhead | using sampling profilers 
    * [2%, 5%] -- depending on a -- few factors
  * store the data
    * low
      * Reason: ğŸ§ efficient compresses ğŸ§ 

### Reduced latency

* Reason: ğŸ§ identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks before ğŸ§ 
* -> 
  * faster application response times,
  * improved user experience -> better business outcomes
  * revenue

### Enhanced incident management

* Reason: ğŸ§ immediate, actionable insights shared ğŸ§
